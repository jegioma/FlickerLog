<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="/public/landingPage.png" />

This is a group project to demonstrate our capabilities to work and develop a full-stack application with the purpose of real-world use. It's developed with [Next JS](https://nextjs.org) with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) as our front-end and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) as our back-end and hosting service. Additionally, we're using the [Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and [The Movie Database API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) to get our data.
